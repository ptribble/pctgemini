This is pctgemini, a minimally viable graphical browser for the Gemini
protocol, written, in Java.

It largely follows the technical overview at
https://geminiprotocol.net/docs/tech-overview.gmi


I did think about calling it jgemini, but later found out that name is
already taken - https://github.com/kevinboone/jgemini
